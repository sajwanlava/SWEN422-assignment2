# Player Types and Motivation

In terms of the design of the game, the team wanted to focus on several specific player archetypes. These types would inform the decisions we made when developing the mini-game, including such aspects as player motivation, game mechanics, scope, complexity and visuals. We decided to focus on two of the player types defined in Bartle's Player Types for gamification; the "Killer" and the "Achiever". Both of these archetypes are focused on performing well in the game. However, where the Achievers are motivated by their score and progress in games, the Killer wants to achieve success by beating other people. As this was a mini-game, we did not want to overcomplicate the design of the prototype by making it a game which primarily caters to explorers or socialisers as that wholly increases the scope of a game. Achievers and killers were also player types we identified among our own player traits within the team, and therefore we felt as though we would be able to relate more to our end users more. Consequently, this allowed the team members to be critical of the product we were developing and which meant that any pilot testing within the team identified vital problems which we smoothed over before testing.
