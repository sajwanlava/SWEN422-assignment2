# Plan 

## Minigame - In VR, Unity or Unreal likely going to be Unity

## Ideas

* **Portal Game - Puzzle Game**
    * **Minimum Requirements:**
    * Players inteact with game via vr controller to move and create portals
    * Players see the consequences of going in and out portals and see it how affects puzzle completion
    * Players are timed on how long takes to complete the puzzle and ranked on time to completion
    * **Motivation to Engage:**
    * Agency - Players have the agency have to make choices on how to solve the puzzle
    * Competence - Players are see how the are doing by completing the puzzle and time takes them complete the puzzle
    * Relatedness - ? Unsure on what this means exactly @snellgnich asking simon about this
    * **Player Types - Bartle Types:**
    * Killer as in compare time scores between people
    * Achivers as in you gain the highest score and have the lowest time

## Concept

### Game Loop
Player needs to navigate their way through several (2-3) short levels by using their portals to get around impassable parts of the level.
Player receives score based on time to complete level, number of portals used to complete level and any additional items retrieved along the way.
Score is added to a leaderboard, player can compare themselves to previous attempts. 

### Interface
* Pointer based vs. Touch based interface?
* everything should be a part of the virtual environment. 
* @snellgnich will clarify with simon regarding the requirements of the interface.

### A/B Testing
* Same input used for menu interaction and projectiles (determined by whether viewing menu) vs different inputs
