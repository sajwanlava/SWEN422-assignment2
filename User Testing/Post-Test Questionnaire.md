I think its disconcerting having the observers talking to you, that was the most vertigo causing thing for me. | When I stood on the green platforms it didn't register me. Also without instructions from the observers it was unclear what the goal was. The tutorial level needs instructions (if I hadn't played portal before I would not have known how the walls worked/portals worked etc) either written or narration. |                                                                                                                                       |
